# Catstronauts

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the first part of our Lift-off series!

Here we begin our journey building a full-stack GraphQL example application called Catstronauts, a learning platform for adventurous cats who want to explore the universe! ðŸ˜º ðŸš€

The first feature we'll build for the app will fetch a (mocked) list of learning tracks from a GraphQL API and display them in a card grid on our homepage.

## Preview

Here's how it'll look when we're finished:

## Introduction

Catstronauts is a full-stack GraphQL example application that serves as a learning platform for cats who are eager to explore the universe. It allows users to browse and enroll in various learning tracks tailored to their interests and skill levels. This project serves as an introductory guide to building a full-stack GraphQL application.

In this first part of the series, we will focus on implementing the homepage feature. We will fetch a list of learning tracks from a GraphQL API and display them in a visually appealing card grid.

## Features

The Catstronauts application will eventually include the following features:

- Homepage: Display a grid of learning tracks fetched from a GraphQL API.
- Track Details: View detailed information about a specific learning track.
- User Authentication: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- Enrollment: Enable users to enroll in learning tracks and track their progress.
- Search: Provide a search functionality to find specific learning tracks.
- Admin Dashboard: Allow administrators to manage learning tracks and user data.

In this README, we will focus on the first feature, the homepage.
